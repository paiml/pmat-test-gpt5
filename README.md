## How the Overall Score is Calculated

The overall score is calculated on a scale of 0-100 points using three key complexity metrics, each with a maximum penalty of 25 points:

### Scoring Components

| Component | Max Penalty | Calculation Method |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Cognitive Complexity** | 25 points | Percentage of functions exceeding cognitive complexity thresholds |
| **Cyclomatic Complexity** | 25 points | Percentage of functions exceeding cyclomatic complexity thresholds |
| **Big-O Complexity** | 25 points | Percentage of functions with high algorithmic complexity (O(n²) or worse) |

### Final Score Formula

```
Final Score = 100 - Cognitive Penalty - Cyclomatic Penalty - Big-O Penalty
```

- **Minimum possible score**: 25/100 (when all three categories reach maximum penalty)
- **Maximum possible score**: 100/100 (when no penalties are applied)

### Penalty Calculation Details

Each penalty is calculated as:
```
Penalty = min(25, (affected_functions / total_functions) × 100)
```

- **Cognitive Complexity**: Functions with high nesting, branching, and logical complexity
- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: Functions with excessive conditional paths and decision points
- **Big-O Complexity**: Functions with O(n²), O(n³), or worse algorithmic complexity

### About the Evaluation System

The Real-World Code Score system evaluates AI-generated code across multiple dimensions to provide a comprehensive quality assessment. Unlike simple correctness checks, it analyzes real-world code quality factors that matter in
production environments.
